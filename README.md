# Purpose

To empower compassionate, empathetic, and cooperative individuals to plan, collaborate, and accomplish large scale tasks normally reserved for corporations of governments. 

Currently figurig out how to make this shit public: https://unifist.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Definition/pages/360452/Purpose

Until then, fuck it, it says (from a straight Copy/Pasta): 

```
Below are what’s known, as in least in Tech Project Management, as User Stories. We use these to determine overall final outcomes, as North Stars. Everyone working on a Project knows these and uses these to guide their decisions. 

As a Human Being, I want:

    Security, Stability, and Prosperity

        Security

            Physical Security

                To not to constantly earn to live

                To have safety buffers

                    To cover for others if they will cover for me

            Financial Security

                To not live pay check to pay check

                    To not be lied to that someone works 10x, 100x, 1000x harder than me.

                To have my finances more influenced by my actions, not birth

        Stability

            To retain my progress

            To know what’s going to happen next

            To be able to plan, and work towards something bug

            My actions to matter

            Fairness

                If I do good, I do good

                If I do bad, I do bad

        Prosperity

            Financial Prosperity

                If the system is growing for one, it should be growing for all 

I will continue to fill these in as in Tech, more of our work is very iterable. Nothing is really done. We should look at what works, and what doesn’t (often something that used to work but doesn’t because we grew) and decide what to improve. We use these user stories to determine what’s working or not: how well are our goals being achieved currently?

Looking at these as a person as yourself, answer these questions:

    Do I understand the Goals? How well?

        Can I explain these to someone familiar with my cause?

        Can I explain these to someone unfamiliar with my cause?

        Can I explain these to your Grandmother?

        Can I explain these to a child?

    Can I personally determine are these Goals being met for me?

        Gut check. How do I feel about each of these?

        Fact check: Can I give specific examples one way or another?

        History check: How did I feel about these before? How am I sure?

    What can I do about it?

        Don’t worry if you don’t know. That’s what we’re all here. 
```

I know how to do a lot of things. I'm going to try to teach you all to teach yourselves how to do a lot of things.
